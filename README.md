## NFL Scores
NFL Scores exposes a clean API for getting live data about the day's nfl scores. It queries nfl.com json endpoints.

#### Installation

    npm install nfl_scores

#### Getting started

###### 1. require it

    var nflScores = require("nfl_scores");

###### 2. use it

    // Acquire the most up to date scores, and inspect them.
    nflScores.refresh(function(err, scores) {
      console.log(scores);
    });

    // Inspect the last set of refreshed scores
    // without sending any network traffic.
    console.log(nflScores.scores);

#### Example dashboard
To view the live scores in an example app, go to the examples/dashboard directory, and run `node app.js`. Point your browser to localhost:3000, and you should see something like this:
